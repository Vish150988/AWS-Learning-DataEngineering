Data Sources
You can load data into Redshift from various AWS services including:

Amazon S3
AWS Kinesis
EMR
DynamoDB
DMS
RDS

Two Main Ways to Load Data
Option 1: Load via S3

Have a Redshift cluster ready
Split your files into multiple files (helps with parallel loading)
Upload files to S3
Create an IAM role with S3 read permissions
Attach the role to your Redshift cluster
Use the COPY command to load the data

Option 2: Load Directly

Load directly from source database to Redshift
Skip the S3 step
Less redundancy but faster

Key Commands
COPY Command

Used to load data into Redshift
Requires:

Target table (where data goes in Redshift)
Source location (where data comes from)
IAM role (for permissions)



UNLOAD Command

Does the opposite - exports data from Redshift to S3
Requires:

Query (what data to export)
Destination (where to send it in S3)
IAM role (for permissions)
Format specification (like PARQUET)



VACUUM Command
Used for maintenance:

VACUUM FULL: Reclaims space completely but takes longer
VACUUM SORT: Resorts rows in your table for better performance
VACUUM REINDEX: Reclaims space and makes queries more effective

These commands help keep your Redshift cluster running efficiently by managing space and organization of your data.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
