Amazon Kinesis: What is it?

Kinesis
1.Fully managed data streaming service that allows you process and analyze streaming data
2.Kinesis is a family of services that consists of Data Streams, Data Firehose, Video Streams and Managed Apache Flink
3.These services aid in the collection, delivery, and analytics of streaming data
4.They are able to interact with AWS and third-party services with low effort

What is Kinesis Data Streams?

Serverless way to stream and store data

Each Stream is composed of a sequence of Shards containing data records
A data record contains a sequence number, partition key, and a data blob up to 1 MB

There are two sides of a stream:
a.Data Producers
b.Data Consumers
A Producer is an application that ingests incoming data into a Stream in near real-time
A Consumer is an application that takes that collected data and processes or stores it

Architecture: Data Flow
Data Producer → Kinesis → Data Consumer
Data Producer:

IoT devices
Log/Event generators
External applications
Servers or container

Kinesis:

Data Stream
Data Firehose

Data Consumer:

S3
Redshift
Third-party software

Amazon Kinesis: Data Firehose
Delivery Stream
Allows you to send data from AWS services or third-party services
Allows you to store data or to send it to services to process the data

Amazon Kinesis: Managed Service for Apache Flink (Data Analytics)
Managed Service for Apache Flink
Allows you to use programming languages or SQL to process your data
Allows you to use notebooks to run commands against your data

Amazon Kinesis: Use Cases
Anomaly detection in IoT
Log Processing for machine learning
Pattern detection
Click Stream Analysis

Benefits of Kinesis
Fully managed service
Serverless
Allows you to capture streaming data in near real-time
Built-in Autoscaling

Kinesis vs SQS
Kinesis:

Stores records by default for 24 hours up to 7 days
Supports multiple consumers of the same data records
Supports in-order processing with a shard however no kind of ordering between shards is guaranteed

Update: AWS Kinesis Data Streams has a default retention period of 24 hours. Using the 7 day retention option is good for helping to resolve downstream data issues. Long-term retention can be up to 365 days.
SQS:

Message retention period can be between 1 minute to 14 days
Only a single consumer at a time, once its read its deleted from the queue
Standard SQS queues don't guarantee in-order processing but FIFO support it with limitations
