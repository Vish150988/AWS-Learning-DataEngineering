How to Load Data into AWS Redshift
Where Data Can Come From
You can load data into Redshift from many AWS services like:

S3
Kinesis
EMR
DynamoDB
DMS
RDS

Two Ways to Load Data
Option 1: Using S3 as Middle Step

Start with a Redshift cluster
Split your files into multiple pieces for faster parallel loading
Upload files to S3
Create an IAM role with permission to read from S3
Connect the role to your Redshift cluster
Use COPY command to bring data from S3 into Redshift

Option 2: Direct Loading

Load straight from your source (like DynamoDB) into Redshift
Skip the S3 step
Faster but you don't have a backup copy in S3

Important Commands
COPY Command

Brings data into Redshift
Needs to know:

Where to put the data in Redshift
Where the data is coming from
What permissions to use



UNLOAD Command

Sends data from Redshift to S3
Needs to know:

What data to export
Where to put it in S3
What format to save it in (like PARQUET)



VACUUM Command
Keeps your database clean and efficient:

VACUUM FULL: Cleans up space completely (takes longer)
VACUUM SORT: Makes sure data is in the right order
VACUUM REINDEX: Makes your database work better and saves space

These commands help your Redshift cluster run smoothly.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses. 3.7 Sonnet
