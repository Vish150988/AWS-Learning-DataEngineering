Amazon Redshift
Redshift allows you to collect data through traditional data warehouses
Data Warehousing allows you to combine different data sources into a single place to run custom analytics
Redshift also allows you to utilize log analysis
Log analysis allows you to get insightful data on user behaviors like how many times they click and what sensors they use.

Redshift Architecture:
Single-Node Cluster
Leader Node
Compute Node
Redshift uses a cluster architecture.

Each cluster is composed of computing resources called nodes.
You can have up to 128 compute nodes.
Two types of nodes:

Leader node
Compute node

Single-Node Cluster
Consists of one compute node.
Best suited for small datasets and testing purposes.


Multi-Node Cluster

Consists of at least two compute nodes.
Best suited for large datasets and production environments.

***************************************************************************************************************************************

Leader Node:

Receives queries from client applications.
Parses the queries and develops query execution plans.
Coordinates parallel execution of these plans.
Aggregates the results of the queries and returns them back to the client.

Compute Node:

Partitions the job into slices (slice management).
Runs the query execution plans.
Sends the intermediate results back to the leader node.
