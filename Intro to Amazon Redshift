AWS Redshift Summary
Core Functionality

Fully-managed data warehousing solution based on PostgreSQL
Optimized for OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) workloads
Column-based storage instead of row-based for better performance
Supports querying petabytes of both structured and semi-structured data
Offers a serverless option for simplified management

Architecture

Cluster-based design with up to 128 nodes per cluster
Two main node types:

Leader Node: Receives queries, develops execution plans, coordinates parallel execution, and returns aggregated results
Compute Node: Partitions data into slices, executes query plans, and sends results back to the leader



Cluster Types

Single-Node Cluster: One compute node, suitable for small datasets or testing
Multi-Node Cluster: Two or more compute nodes, suited for large datasets and production workloads

Node Types

Dense Compute (DC): For demanding workloads requiring high compute capacity
Dense Storage (DS): Optimized for storage-intensive workloads (slower performance)
RA3: Modern option that scales compute and storage independently, can automatically offload data to S3

Scaling Options

Concurrency Scaling: Automatically adds compute power temporarily for concurrent read requests
Redshift Spectrum: Query data directly in S3 without loading into Redshift
Cluster Resizing:

Elastic Resize: Faster in-place resizing, retains system logs, only supports upgrading node types
Classic Resize: Takes longer but can change node types, doesn't retain system logs



Deployment & Security

Can be deployed in specific VPCs with security and networking isolation
Supports multi-availability zone deployments similar to RDS, Aurora, and DynamoDB

AWS recommends RA3 nodes over Dense Storage nodes for better flexibility in cloud environments.
